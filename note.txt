Notes:
1. The language only supports declarations and assignments.
2. Declarations and assignments are 2 different statements, i.e. you can't assign a variable on declaration.
3. A variable can be assigned a value (int, string, double, char), or another variable, or an expression.
4. Addition and subtraction are the only 2 expressions supported.

Semantic errors:
1. A variable used without being declared.
2. Type mismatch (int and doubles are considered matching type, i.e, we support downcasting).
3. A variable used without being initialized.
4. A variable declared twice (same name).

Symbol table:
1. The symbol table only shows values for non-expression statements, so any statements that contain expressions, the value field will be wrong, since we don't support mathemtical oeprations here.
